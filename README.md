#Project Overview - Student Journal

In this project we would like to see you demonstrate your full stack coding skills by creating a simple student journal. The journal is a place for students to enter notes throughout their course.  
In the journal, students should be able to complete the following tasks: • View a list of previous journal entries
• Submit a new journal entry
• Edit a previous journal entry
• Delete a previous journal entry
• Choose between 2 different visual themes such as a light and dark mode
When submitting a new journal entry, the form should include:
• Title
• Description
• Inspiring Quote (see below)
Date and Time should be saved for each entry and displayed on the journal list view but should not show on the entry/edit forms.
The Inspiring Quote should be created via an API request to one of the following services - https://theysaidso.com/api/ OR https://zenquotes.io/. It should be displayed to the user on the entry form, but not editable. It should be saved to a Quotes table and a reference ID for the quote should be saved in the Entry table. The Quote text should also show on the list view.
The journal should be displayed in a visually pleasing manner. Color palette, font, layout, etc. are up to you.  
Key Requirements
• You must set up the project on a public server and provide us with a URL to view it. • All original code should be provided for our review (non-compiled, non-minified) • We prefer the application to be built with Node.js/Express (PHP/Laravel is an acceptable alternative)
• We use Vue.js as our front-end framework. This project does not require you to use Vue.js, but it is a plus.
• Responses should be stored in a database and the database should have at least 2 tables (entry, quote)
• We want to see your coding skills. There are lots of examples available on the internet. Do not copy examples. Please build the application by yourself.
